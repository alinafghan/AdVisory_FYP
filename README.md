# AdVisory_FYP

AdVisory is an AI-powered social media campaign management and audit website designed in collaboration with SocialChamp to automate, enhance, and optimize social media ad campaigns. 
We intend to leverage AI to transform how advertisers and web designers approach their work. The tool will provide detailed insights on ads, enabling users to optimize their campaigns and designs before they go live. With the help of CV models, it will analyze advertisements based on pre-existing benchmarks and competitor ads.
Additional features also include using genAI to enhance the efficiency of ad creation while maintaining transparency with our users and alleviating ethical concerns. We intend to perform prompt engineering to tailor the output to our users precise needs. We will also use self-built predictive models to predict future market trends and optimize budget allocation and post-scheduling. 
Simplifying and automating campaign design will achieve business goals with minimal manual intervention. The eventual aim is to provide marketers with financial insights and data-driven campaign strategies that yield superior results across various social media platforms.
